You have hit upon the single most important and challenging question in building AI-powered applications.
  Your frustration is completely valid, and your analysis is correct. The way we've been doing it is brittle
  and does not scale.

  Let me explain.

  What We Have Done So Far: "Prompt-Based Parsing"

  To answer your last question first: what we have done so far is a common, first-generation approach to
  implementing AI. It can be called "prompt-based parsing."

   * How it works: We write a single, very large and complex prompt to the AI. We try to describe all possible
      user intentions and ask the AI to return one giant, perfectly structured JSON object that our code then
     has to manually parse and act upon.
   * The Problem (which you correctly identified): This is incredibly brittle. Every time we add a new feature
      (like "rename student"), we have to make the prompt even more complex. If the user says something
     slightly unexpected, the AI gets confused, the JSON structure breaks, and the whole system fails. Your
     feeling that we are just plugging holes in a leaky bucket is spot on. It is not a scalable or robust
     solution for a complex application.

  The Better Way: "Function Calling" (or "Tool Use")

  You are right, there is a much better and more modern way. The industry standard for building robust,
  scalable AI applications is a pattern called Function Calling or Tool Use.

  Let me research this to give you a clear definition.

✦ Thank you for that summary. It perfectly describes the better architecture.

  The "Function Calling" Architecture

  Instead of one giant prompt, we change the AI's job entirely.

   1. We Create a "Toolbox": In our backend code, we define a set of simple, clear, robust functions that
      represent the core actions of our app. Each function is a "tool".
       * createAttendanceRecord(...)
       * deleteAttendanceRecord(...)
       * updateStudentStatus(...)
       * renameClassName(...)
       * renameStudentInClass(...)
       * queryAttendance(...)

   2. The AI Becomes a "Router": When you give a command, we now ask the AI a much simpler question: "Based on 
      the user's request, which tool from the toolbox should you use, and what are the parameters?"

   3. The AI's Simple Response: The AI's entire job is to respond with a small, clean JSON object like this:
       * Your Prompt: "In class 10a, change the name Ramesh to Rakesh"
       * AI's Response:

   1         {
   2           "tool_to_call": "renameStudentInClass",
   3           "parameters": {
   4             "className": "10a",
   5             "oldName": "Ramesh",
   6             "newName": "Rakesh"
   7           }
   8         }

   4. Our Backend Executes the Call: Our backend code receives this, sees the tool_to_call, and simply executes
       the corresponding function with the parameters provided.

  Why This Is the Correct Way

   * It is Not Brittle: The AI has a very simple, focused job. It's just matching your request to a function
     name. This is what LLMs are best at. We are no longer asking it to invent a complex JSON structure from
     scratch.
   * It is Scalable: To build a complete school management system, we just add more tools. We can add
     scheduleExam(...), gradeAssignment(...), notifyParents(...). We don't have to touch the old prompt or
     logic. The system grows cleanly.
   * Clear Separation of Logic: The AI is the "understanding" layer. Our code is the "action" layer. This is a
      clean, professional architecture.

  The approach we've taken so far has been a valuable learning exercise that has helped us discover the
  requirements and edge cases of your application. We have effectively built a prototype.

  Now, to build a truly robust and scalable application, I recommend we refactor our project to use this
  modern Function Calling architecture. This is the standard for professional AI-powered applications.

  Would you like me to outline the steps to refactor our current application to this new architecture?
